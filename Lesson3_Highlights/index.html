            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The versioning control system is the one main stop for all the project files. This system helps solve the file sharing system because it automatically knows the revision history, when they were changed, what changed and if the changes were merged into the same file. A benefit of the version control system is that it cannot be overwritten and that the last file is held. The versioning control system also be worked on at the same time without there being a problem and it can be changed back to an older version if you need to.</div>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote repositories are versions of a project that is on the internet or a network somewhere. A person can have several of them but they are either read only or read and write. Working with other people includes managing the remote repositories and moving the data around when the work needs to be shared. When a person manages a remote repository then the person has to know how to add them and remove the repositories that are invalid and cannot be used anymore. They also have to manage different remote branches and observe and define if they are tracked or not.</div>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a copy of your own work that is a cache of the remote downloads, and it also contains the temporary files that have not yet been released. The local and remote repositories are set up and structured the same way so that the scripts can be easily ran on either the developer side or the client side. They can also be synced and set up for offline use. As a general fact a person should not need to do anything to the local repository on a regular basis except to clean it if you run out of disk space.</div>

                <span class="text-muted">What is GIT?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a version control system that is used for tracking changes in computer files, managing and organizing the work on those files that are used by multiple people. It is also an open source distributed version control system that was made to take care of small and very large projects really fast and done efficiently. GIT is usually used to develop software but it can also be used to take care and keep track of any changes that are made to the file. Because it is a distributed revision control system it focuses on speed, making sure that there are no problems with the data and as a support for workflows that are not linear.</div>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed version control system</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A distributed version control system lets developers work on a certain project without making them share a common network. Software revisions are stored in these distributed version control systems. The distributed version control system allows every user that is involved to have a copy of all the repository data stored on their machine. Since everything is in a local place it is possible to work offline and it runs much faster, but there are multiple places where a problem could happen. But GIT can prevent an accidental overwrite of a file that is shared on the repository.</div>
